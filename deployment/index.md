# Deployment

  - release note file
  - release note index
  - release file

Questions and Outstanding Issues

- how do we get signoff for a release?
- process for release request is not great:
  - JIRA ticket template is not specific to releases
  - Should have a clear policy for scheduling ...
    - specific day of week, time of day?
    - how many days after request can we expect it to be done?
    - how to roll back?
    - our images are tagged "latest" - by version would be easier to rollback
