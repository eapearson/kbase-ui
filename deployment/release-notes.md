# Release Notes

Every release is accompanied by a release notes document which describes notable changes made to kbase-ui after the prior release

Release notes follow a template, which provides sections for different types of changes.

Although the release notes document contains the release description, other files are also required to be updated with release information.

Each release receives a semver 2.0 compatible version identifier.
