# KBase kbase-ui 1.8.10 Release Notes

## CHANGES

This is a bugfix release. The ontology landing pages were broken, and have been fixed. The pangenome landing pages were improved.

This will be the final, or nearly final, release for the 1.x.x release line, a new major update is in the works which removes most direct plugin integration support, rather porting all but internal plugins to an iframe-based architecture.
