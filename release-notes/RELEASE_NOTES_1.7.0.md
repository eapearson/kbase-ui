# KBase kbase-ui 1.7.0 Release Notes

This release brings two new features - a landing page for reports and ORCiD as an auth provider.

Data search now groups feature search (still unreleased) by parent genome. This was accomplished with search engine and search interface changes.

Fixes were brought to the job viewer & catalog, taxonomy widget for landing pages, and several internal improvements.

Two new in-progress features are available in CI only - dashboard2, a refactored dashboard with roughly the same shape but rewritten guts and featuring some narrative controls - deletion, sharing; system alert, which appear at the top (below the header) when active.
